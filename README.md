# SequenceAnalysisExample
Sequence Analysis of Genetic using Python3

The project was made in IDE "Jupyter Notebook".

It is a basic project consisting of:

1)Counting Base Pairs.

2)Complementary Base Pair.

3)Genetic Transcription.

4)Translation of genetic information.


To do this, I have not used any libraries, only basic python concepts (If statement, loops, lists, dictionary, functions, etc).
